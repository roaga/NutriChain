### Problem
-----------------
In 2018 alone, more than 35 million people in the US were food insecure, with over 4.6 million having very low food security. Even though food banks try to supply food to as many people as possible, satisfying full need for the entire food-insecure population is far from reality. What’s more? Younger generation feels a social stigma attached to food banks – of having to drive by foodbanks to get food. Heck, even older population! Furthermore, during such a tough time with Covid, we wanted to develop a solution that would ease the food insecurity of millions of not only American households but also homes across the world. By providing a sustainable delivery system that relies on the free will of the people, foodbanks can expend the money they spend on delivery on securing food resources during a time of relative food scarcity and insecurity

### Solution
----------------
We want to revolutionize how food banks work. We want to open up a new world of volunteer-based doordash for the lower sectors of society instead of having trucks deliver packages of food throughout the country and that is exactly what we have done. We present to you NutriChain, a mobile app for practically everyone including food banks and individuals, where a food bank simply registers with their meal plan, and once a particular family/individual places an order, volunteers come together to deliver the food at their convenience with very minimal time spent as the delivery is a chain of volunteers and not just one person.  
##### Process
First the user who wants food orders it from the foodbank. The foodbank processes the order, waiting for any pickup requests. Person A issues a pickup request from their home and picks up the food and brings it to their home. Person B issues a pickup request to pickup the food from Person A's home. Finally the user picks up from Person B's home at gets his food. This is especially useful, as the trucks will not have to go around delivering the food and the chaining method allows for delivery over long distances. 

### Technicalities
-------------------
We have used Firebase Firestore to manage data from the cloud, and Firebase Authentication to manage the two users (foodbank or individual). We have built the entire app on React Native and JS to allow for cross-platform compatibility.
